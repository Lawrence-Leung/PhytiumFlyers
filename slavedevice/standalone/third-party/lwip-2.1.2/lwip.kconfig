            Set UDP receive mail box size. The recommended value is 6.

            UDP receive mail box is a per socket mail box, when the application receives packets
            from UDP socket, LWIP core firstly posts the packets to UDP receive mail box and the
            application then fetches the packets from mail box. It means LWIP can caches maximum
            UDP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE packets for each UDP socket, so the maximum possible cached UDP packets
            for all UDP sockets is UDP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE multiples the maximum UDP socket number. In other
            words, the bigger UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE means more memory.
            On the other hand, if the receiv mail box is too small, the mail box may be full. If the
            mail box is full, the LWIP drops the packets. So generally we need to make sure the UDP
            receive mail box is big enough to avoid packet drop between LWIP core and application.

            Set TCP receive mail box size. Generally bigger value means higher throughput
            but more memory. The recommended value is: LWIP_TCP_WND_DEFAULT/TCP_MSS + 2, e.g. if
            LWIP_TCP_WND_DEFAULT=14360, TCP_MSS=1436, then the recommended receive mail box size is
            (14360/1436 + 2) = 12.

            TCP receive mail box is a per socket mail box, when the application receives packets
            from TCP socket, LWIP core firstly posts the packets to TCP receive mail box and the
            application then fetches the packets from mail box. It means LWIP can caches maximum
            LWIP_TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE packets for each TCP socket, so the maximum possible cached TCP packets
            for all TCP sockets is LWIP_TCP_RECCVMBOX_SIZE multiples the maximum TCP socket number. In other
            words, the bigger LWIP_TCP_RECVMBOX_SIZE means more memory.
            On the other hand, if the receiv mail box is too small, the mail box may be full. If the
            mail box is full, the LWIP drops the packets. So generally we need to make sure the TCP
            receive mail box is big enough to avoid packet drop between LWIP core and application.
